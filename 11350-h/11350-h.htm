    <p>
      Who has not heard of Exeter 'Change? celebrated all over
      England for its menagerie and merchandize&mdash;wild beasts
      and cutlery&mdash;kangaroos and fleecy
      hosiery&mdash;elephants and minikin pins&mdash;a strange
      assemblage of nature and art&mdash;and savage and polished
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At page 69 of the present volume we have given a brief sketch
      of the "Ancient Site of the Exeter 'Change," &amp;c.; showing
      how the magnificent house of Burleigh, where Queen Elizabeth
      deigned to visit her favourite treasurer&mdash;at length
      became a receptable for uncourtly beasts, birds, and
      reptiles, whilst the lower part became a little nation of
      shopkeepers, among whom shine conspicuous the parsimony and
      good fortune of Mr. Clarke, the cutler, who amassed here a
      princely fortune. But the march of improvement having
      condemned the whole of the building, "Exeter 'Change is
      removed to Charing Cross." Mr. Cross's occupation's gone, and
      the wild beasts have progressed nearer the Court by removing
      to the King's Mews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely such a place is worthy of preservation in a graphic
      sketch for THE MIRROR. Perhaps its wonders were once the goal
      of our wishes&mdash;to receive a long bill from the jolly
      yeoman at the door, to see the living wonders of the upper
      story, and be treated with a pocket knife or whistle-whip
      from the counters of the lower apartments, have probably at
      one period or other been grand treats. Yes, gentle reader,
      and two doors east of this world of wonders appeared the
      early numbers of the present Miscellany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the improvement projects, we hear that a building for
      the meetings of public societies is to occupy the above site.

    <h3>
      RECENT BALLOON ASCENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>June</i> 10, 1829.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;With your permission, I will attempt to describe
      the magnificent scene I witnessed on my ascent with Mr. G.
      Green, in his balloon, on Wednesday, June 10th, 1829; but I
      really want the power of language to depict its grandeur; for
      no poetic taste, or pencil of man, can unfold the splendid
      scene we enjoyed while traversing the ethereal regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having implicit confidence in the skill of Mr. Green I
      ascended with him from the Jamaica, Tea-gardens, Rotherhithe,
      amidst the acclamations of the multitude, whose forms and
      voices soon passed away; the busy hum of men (with us) ceased
      in a few seconds, and a solemn stillness reigned over the
      metropolis. The serenity of the evening threw a degree of
      solemnity over the scene, which had the effect of
      enchantment. We never lost sight of the earth, for our voyage
      was perfectly cloudless. The fields and buildings were all in
      miniature proportions, though most exquisitely depicted; and
      as Greenwich Hospital, the Tower of London, St. Paul's,
      &amp;c. apparently receded from our view, the country
      succeeded, resembling one continued garden. The fields of
      wheat, &amp;c. were beautifully defined, and the clearness of
      the atmosphere threw a sort of varnish (if I may use the
      term) over the whole face of nature. We had the Thames in
      view the whole of the time, which appeared like a rivulet of
      silver; but below Kingston Bridge, about half an hour after
      our ascent, the setting sun <i>gilded</i> its surface with
      magnificent effect. The boats appeared like little pieces of
      cork. The Penitentiary, at Millbank, had the resemblance of a
      twelfth cake cut into quarters; St. Paul's and the Tower of
      London could be distinctly seen, the light falling happily
      upon their proportions. Old and New London Bridges, were like
      two feeble efforts of the works of man; and here we saw the
      triumph of nature over art, and the littleness of the great
      works of man. At one time, on nearing Battersea Bridge, we
      observed a small, black streak ascending from the surface of
      the Thames, which we concluded to be the smoke from a
      Richmond steam packet. At that time the course of the balloon
      was south-east, although the smoke above alluded to was
      driven towards the west. The air being so serene we felt no
      motion in the car, and we could only know we were quietly
      moving, from seeing the grappling irons (which hung from the
      car) pass over the earth rapidly from field to field; whilst
      the scene seemed to recede from our view like a moving
      panorama. At our greatest altitude a solemn stillness
      prevailed, and I cannot describe its awful grandeur and my
      excitement. We then let loose a pigeon, and having a
      favourable country below, we prepared to descend, and Mr.
      Green hailed some men with the cry of "we are coming down." I
      saw them run (though very small,) and we fell in a field of
      wheat, near Kingston, with scarcely any rebound; in fact a
      child might have alighted with safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, Mr. Editor, ended this short and rapid, but splendid
      voyage. On our alighting, Mr. Green wrote on a piece of paper
      our safe arrival, which he tied to the neck of a pigeon, and
      sent him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our greatest altitude did not exceed one mile and a quarter,
      in consequence, as Mr. Green informed me, of the density of
      the atmosphere, which would, at a greater elevation, have
      dimmed the splendour of the scene beneath us.
    </p>
    <h4>
      P.T.W.
    </h4>
    <p>
      [We thank our ingenious Correspondent for the previous
      description of his recent aerial voyage, as we are fully
      aware of the difficulty of describing such a magnificent
      scene as he must have witnessed in his ascent. During the
      whole voyage, he experienced nothing but sensations of
      delight; the atmosphere being only disturbed by very light
      wind, just sufficient to waft the aeronauts without any
      laborious management, and the time&mdash;evening&mdash;being
      beautifully serene. We thought ourselves richly rewarded by
      the view of the Colosseum Panorama, but what must have been
      their sensations at a distance of 6,600 feet high, when with
      the huge machine they appeared little more than a speck. The
      varnish, or glare, which our Correspondent describes, was
      that charming effect which we are wont to admire here, on
      earth, in evening scenes, especially when they are lit up by
      the splendour of the setting sun; but which must be doubly
      enchanting when viewed from so great an altitude. He likewise
      tells us that the landscape appeared to recede like a moving
      panorama, whilst the balloon seemed to be stationary; so that
      the scenic attempt at Covent Garden Theatre, a few years
      since, to illustrate a balloon ascent, by moving scenery, was
      in accordance with the real effect, though, we think, the
      theatrical attempt was not so appreciated at the time it was
      made. In conclusion, we congratulate our friend upon his
      splendid recreation, for such his ascent must have been.]

          'Tis virtue's essence,&mdash;'tis benevolence

        <p>
          It is the first perfection of our nature;
        </p>

          It is the brightest attribute of heav'n:

      THE PENDRILS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir,&mdash;From a note which I have just seen at the foot of
      the interesting account of the escape of Charles the Second,
      in vol. v. of the MIRROR, the reader is led to conclude, that
      the pension granted to Richard Pendril, expired at his death.
      No such thing. Old Dr. Pendril lived, practised, and died at
      Alfriston, a little town in the east of Sussex, some forty or
      fifty years since. His son, John Pendril, died at Eastbourn,
      four or five years ago. His son, Mr. John Pendril, kept a
      public house at Lewes, a few years since, to which he added
      the appropriate sign of the "Royal Oak." All these in
      succession enjoyed the pension of &mdash;&mdash; marks,
      granted by Charles the Second, together with something of a
      sporting character called "free warren." The last Mr. John
      Pendril was lately living at or near Brighton.

      EATING "MUTTON COLD."
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Be good enough to insert the solution of <i>Hen. B</i>.'s
      difficulty in your last MIRROR, which I send at foot, and
      thereby oblige a constant
    </p>
    <h4>
      SUBSCRIBER AND FRIEND.
    </h4>
    <p>
      The solution, or attempt at solution, of <i>Hen. B</i>.'s
      difficulty as to what Goldsmith means in his poem
      "Retaliation" when he concludes his ironical eulogium on
      Edmund Burke, thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "In short 'twas his fate, unemployed, or in place, sir,
        </p>
        <p>
          To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      By being "unemployed" it is presumed that he was not engaged
      in the ordinary avocations of life, or in other words was not
      engaged in those legitimate avocations which have for their
      object the procuring the means of subsistence for the
      masticator; but if it is meant to have a name of extensive
      meaning, the solution is unanswerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming the former to be Goldsmith's meaning, the answer to
      be given to the solution might be that eating mutton cold, is
      eating cold mutton in its cold state, cooked or uncooked; but
      if the more general meaning is insisted upon, I cannot see
      how the masticator is unemployed, as his jaws which form a
      most material part of himself&mdash;are set in full motion by
      the operation of eating&mdash;hence full employment is given
      them&mdash;and as much to the "he" who is the owner of such
      jaws.

      128. <i>The Defence of Saragossa</i>.&mdash;D.
      Wilkie.&mdash;The subject is so well explained in the
      Catalogue, that we quote it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heroine Augustina is here represented on the battery, in
      front of the convent of Santa Engratia, where her husband
      being slain, she found her way to the station he had
      occupied, stept over his body, took his place at the gun, and
      declared she would herself avenge his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The principal person engaged in placing the gun is Don
      Joseph Palafox, who commanded the garrison during the
      memorable siege, but who is here represented in the habit of
      a volunteer. In front of him is the Reverend Father
      Consola&ccedil;ion, an Augustin Friar, who served
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page420" name="page420"></a>[pg
      420]</span> with great ability as an engineer, and who, with
      the crucifix in his hand, is directing at what object the
      cannon is to be pointed. On the left side of the picture is
      seen Basilico Boggiero, a priest, who was tutor to Palafox,
      celebrated for his share in the defence, and for his cruel
      fate when he fell into the hands of the enemy. He is writing
      a despatch to be sent by a carrier pigeon, to inform their
      distant friends of the unsubdued energies of the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this part of the room are half a dozen excellent
      portraits, all by different artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      149. <i>The Soldier's Wife</i>&mdash;W.F.
      Witherington.&mdash;This picture is from an anecdote of the
      late Duke of York. His Royal Highness, as he returned one day
      from a walk, observed a poor woman in tears, sent away from
      his house. On asking the servant who she was, he answered, "A
      beggar, some soldier's wife." "A soldier's wife!" returned
      his Royal Highness; "give her immediate relief: what is your
      mistress but a soldier's wife?"&mdash;An interesting picture,
      although we do not think the likeness of the benevolent Duke
      is very striking. However, the incident must have occurred a
      few years previous to his decease.
    </p>
    <p>
      157. <i>Lord Byron's Dream</i>.&mdash;C.L. Eastlake.&mdash;A
      rich oriental landscape, and a most delightful scene of
      desert stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      172. <i>Portrait of Robert Southey, Esq.</i>&mdash;Sir T.
      Lawrence&mdash;We hope the president's portrait will please
      the laureate, for he has been rather tenacious about his
      "likenesses" which have been engraved. The present is,
      perhaps, one of the most intellectual portraits in the room,
      but is too energetic even for the impassioned poet.

      181. <i>Queen Margaret of Anjou</i>, being defeated at the
      battle of Hexham, flies with the young prince into a forest,
      where she meets with robbers, to whose protection she
      confides her son.&mdash;H. P. Briggs.&mdash;This subject is

      224. <i>Roman Princess, with her Attendant, washing the

      246. <i>Camilla introduced to Gil Blas at the
      Inn</i>.&mdash;G. S. Newton.&mdash;This picture is considered
      to be Mr. Newton's <i>chef d'oeuvre</i>. The landlord is
      entering the chamber with a flambeau in his hand lighting in
      a lady, more beautiful than young, and very richly dressed;
      she is supported by an old squire, and a little Moorish page
      carries her train. The lankiness of Camilla is somewhat
      objectionable, but the head is exquisitely animated. The
      sentimentality of Gil Blas too, is excellent.

    <p>
      352. <i>Coronation of the Remains of Ines de
      Castro</i>.&mdash;G. St. Evie.&mdash;An attractive picture of
      one of the most extraordinary scenes in history. The remains
      of Dona Ines de Castro taken out of her tomb six years after
      the interment, when she was proclaimed queen of Portugal.
      This is an illustration of Mrs. Hemans's beautiful lines

      455. <i>Portrait of Mrs. Locke, sen</i>.&mdash;Sir T.

      and which we take to be an excellent likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      592. <i>Portrait of John Parker, Esq. on his favourite horse
      Coroner, with the Worcestershire fox hounds</i>.&mdash;T.
      Woodward.&mdash;We can relate a curious circumstance
      connected with this picture. While in the room, a country
      gentleman and his lady inquired of us the subject&mdash;we
      turned to the number in the Catalogue, and gave him the
      desired information. "Ah," said he, "I was sure it was
      <i>Parker</i>, and told my wife the same, although I was not
      previously aware of his portrait being in the Exhibition." We
      should think the resemblance must be very striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Antique Academy</i> is almost covered with portraits,
      and the miniatures hang in cluster-like abundance&mdash;so
      that what with bright eyes and luxuriant tresses, this is not
      the least attractive of the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <i>Library</i> are several fine architectural
      drawings; among which is a view of Chatsworth, by Sir J.
      Wyatville, including, as we suppose, all the magnificent
      additions and improvements, now in progress there. Mr.
      Soane's Designs for entrances to the Parks and the western
      part of London, (which we alluded to in our No. 360,) are

      It would be easy to extend this notice through the present
      and next number, but as other matters press, and as all the
      town go to Somerset House, we hope this notice will be
      sufficient; for it is not in our power to enumerate half the
      fine pictures in the Exhibition, much as we rejoice at this
      flourishing prospect of British art.

      MULREADY'S "WOLF AND LAMB."
    </h3>
    <p>
      In a preceding number we stated that the copyright of this
      picture had been purchased for 1,000 guineas, and
      appropriated to the Artists' Fund, which a correspondent, and
      "a member of the Fund," informs us is not the fact. He
      assures us that the original picture was purchased some years
      since by his Majesty, who granted the loan of it to the
      society, at whose expense it was engraved; the sale of the
      prints producing 1,000<i>l</i>. to the Fund. Mr. Mulready has
      the merit of painting the picture and procuring the loan of
      it; but our version of the affair would make it appear
      otherwise. We copied our notice from the newspapers, where it
      was stated, as from the Lord Chancellor, at the Fund Dinner,
      that Mr. Mulready had relinquished his copyright to the
      picture for the benefit of the Fund, which had thus produced
      1,000<i>l</i>.; but we thank our correspondent for his
      correction.

    <h3>
      THE IDIOT GIRL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Peverell reached his own house, his man Francis met him
      with a strangely mysterious look and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is one within," said he, "that will not, by any dint of
      persuasion, go; though I have been two good hours trying my
      skill to that end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it?" inquired Peverell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, neither, can I discover," quoth Francis. "She knocked
      at the door&mdash;it might be something after eleven, perhaps
      near upon twelve&mdash;and when I opened it, she whips into
      the hall without saying a word, walks into every room in the
      house&mdash;I following her, as a beadle follows a rogue,
      till he sees him beyond the parish bounds&mdash;and at last
      takes possession of your low chair, and, without so much as
      'by your leave,' begins to wring her hands, and cry 'Lord!
      Lord!'&mdash;What do you want, good woman?" said I. But I
      might as well have addressed myself to the walls, for 'Lord!
      Lord!' was all her moan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peverell hastened into the room, and there he saw poor
      Madge&mdash;her face buried in her hands, rocking to and fro,
      weeping most piteously, and as Francis had described, ever
      and anon calling upon the Lord, but in a tone of such utter
      wretchedness, that it pierced his very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to her. She started up at the sound of his voice,
      looked at him, and then mournfully exclaimed, while she
      pointed to the ground&mdash;"They have buried her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then be comforted," said Peverell, in a kind and soothing
      voice; "your hardest trial is past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a churl he was!" continued Madge, not heeding the words
      of Peverell; "I only asked him to keep the grave open till
      to-morrow, and he denied me! Only till to-morrow&mdash;for
      then, said I, the cold earth can cover us both. But he denied
      me! So I fell upon my knees, beside my Marian's grave, and
      prayed that he might never lose a child, to know that
      blessedness of sorrow which lies in the thought of soon
      sleeping with those we have loved and lost! It was very wrong
      in me, I know, to wish to call down such affliction on
      him&mdash;but he denied me&mdash;and I had to hear the
      rattling dust fall upon her coffin&mdash;ay, and to see that
      dark, deep grave filled up; as if a mother might not have her
      own child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor afflicted creature!" exclaimed Peverell, in a half
      whisper to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said Madge, drying her tears with her hands. "Yes! I
      have walked with grief, for my companion in this world,
      through many a sad and weary hour. But I shook hands with
      her, and we parted, at the grave of Marian. I buried all my
      troubles there. What is the hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>[pg
      422]</span> "Hard upon two," replied Peverell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must be busy," replied Madge, in a wild, hurried
      manner, and smiling at Peverell, with a look of much
      importance, as if what she had to do were some profound
      secret. "You'll not betray me, if I tell you?" she continued,
      taking his hand&mdash;"Feel!" and she placed it on her heart.
      "One, two; one, two; one, two&mdash;and so it goes on; it
      cannot beat beyond two! Oh, God! in what pain it is before it
      breaks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She now returned to the chair from which she had risen, at
      the sound of Peverell's voice. He approached nearer; and
      (with a view rather to draw her gently from her own thoughts,
      than from any desire that she should leave his house,) he
      asked her "if she would go home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she replied; "bear with me yet a little while, and
      I'll go. It is near the time I promised Marian, when last I
      kissed her wintry cheek, as she lay shrouded in her coffin;
      and I may not fail. Lord! Lord! what a troubled and worthless
      world this seems to me now! A week ago, and the sun, and the
      moon, and the stars, and the green earth, and all that was
      upon it, were dear to mine eyes; and I should have wept to
      look my last at them! But now, I behold nothing it contains,
      save my Marian's grave! You will see <i>me</i> laid in it,
      for pity's sake&mdash;won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Peverell, "but that will be when I am gray, and
      thinking of my own: so, cheer up. He that shall toll the bell
      for thee, now sleeps in his cradle, I'll warrant."
    </p>
    <p>
      She beckoned Peverell to her, and taking his hand, she again
      placed it on her heart. A sad, melancholy smile played for a
      moment across her pale wrinkled face, and her glazed eyes
      kindled into a fleeting expressing of frightful gladness, as
      she feebly exclaimed, "Do you feel?
      One!&mdash;one!&mdash;one! &mdash;and hardly that&mdash;I
      breathe only from here," she continued, pointing to her
      throat.
      "Feel!&mdash;feel!&mdash;one!&mdash;one!&mdash;another!&mdash;how
      I gasp&mdash;see!&mdash;see&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased to speak; the hand which retained Peverell's
      relaxed its hold&mdash;her head dropped&mdash;one long-drawn
      sigh was heaved&mdash;and poor Madge resigned a being touched
      with sympathies and feelings not often found in natures of
      nobler quality, in the world's catalogue of nobility. If,
      among the thousand doors which death holds open for mortal
      man to pass through, ere he puts on immortality, there be
      one, the rarest of them all, for broken hearts, this hapless
      creature found it. A self accusing spirit bowed her to the
      earth, with the sharpest of all griefs&mdash;a mother's
      anguish for an only child&mdash;lost to her, as gamesters
      lose fortunes&mdash;thrown away by her own hand.

    <h3>
      FITZMAURICE THE MAGICIAN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "<i>I have lived three hundred years!</i> In that
      time&mdash;in all that time, I have never seen the glorious
      sun descend, but followed still its rolling course through
      the regions of illimitable space. I have shivered on the
      frozen mountains of the icy north, and fainted beneath the
      sultry skies of the blazing east: the swift winds have been
      my viewless chariot, and on their careering wings I have been
      hurried from clime to clime. But, nor light, nor air, nor
      heat, nor cold, have been to me as to the rest of my species;
      for I was doomed to find in their extremes a perpetual
      torment. I howled, under the sharp, pinching pangs of the icy
      north; I panted with agony, in the scorching fervour of the
      blazing east; and when mine eyes have ached, with vain
      efforts, to pierce the darkness of the earth's centre, they
      have been suddenly blasted with excessive and intolerable
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the currents of human affection&mdash;all that makes the
      past delightful, the present lovely, and the future coveted,
      were dried up within me. My heart was like the sands of the
      desert, parched and barren. No living stream of hope, of
      gladness, or of desire, quickened it with human sympathies.
      It was a bleak and withered region, the fit abode of
      ever-during sorrow and comfortless despair. I was as a
      blighted tree, that perishes not at the root, but is withered
      in all its branches. Tears, I had none. One gracious drop,
      falling from my seared orbs, would have been the blessed
      channel of pent-up griefs that seemed to crush my almost
      frenzied brain. Sighs, I breathed not. They would have heaved
      from my bursting heart some of that misery, which loaded it
      to anguish. Sleep never came. I was denied the common luxury
      of the common wretched, to lose, in its sweet oblivion, its
      brief forgetfulness, the sense of what I was. Death, natural
      death, closed his many doors against me. All that lived,
      except myself&mdash;the persecuted, the weary, and the
      heavily laden of man's race&mdash;could find a grave! I,
      alone, looked upon the earth, and felt that it had no resting
      place for me! God! God! what a forlorn and miserable creature
      is man, when, in his affliction, he cannot say to the worm, I
      shall be yours! I might have cast away, indeed, the
      YENARKON&mdash;the Giver of Life&mdash;the elixir of the
      Sibyl&mdash;but that would have been to subject myself to a
      power of darkness, in whose fell
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page423" name="page423"></a>[pg
      423]</span> wrath I should have suffered the casting away of
      mine eternal soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus the stream of time rolled on, burying beneath its dark
      waves, our little span of present, in the huge ocean of a
      perpetual past, and devouring, as the food of both, our swift
      decaying future. But I floated on its surface, and beheld
      whole generations flourish and fade away, while age and
      silver hairs, growing infirmities, and the closing sigh that
      ends them all, mocked me with a horrible exemption. I
      remained, and might have remained, for ages yet to come, the
      fixed and unaltered image of what I was, when in Mauritania I
      encountered the potent Amaimon, the damned magician of the
      den, but for that&mdash;woman's faith, and man's
      fidelity&mdash;which have made me what I AM!
    </p>
    <p>
      "This <i>was</i> my destiny. Now mark, how I became
      enthralled to it; and how it befell, that at last I shook it
      off, and found redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my middle manhood, when scarcely forty summers had glowed
      within my veins, I left my native Italy, and journeyed to the
      Holy Land, upon the strict vow of a self-imposed penance. It
      was for no sin committed in my days of youth, but for the
      satisfaction of an ardent piety, and the growing spirit of a
      long enkindled devotion. I had patrimonial wealth in Apulia;
      I had kindred; I had friends. I renounced them all, to
      dedicate myself, thenceforth, to the service of THE CROSS. My
      purpose was blessed, by a virtuous mother's prayers, that I
      might approve myself a worthy soldier of Christ; and it was
      sanctified by a holy priest at the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even now, the recollection is strong within me, of the
      feelings with which, as the rising sun illumined the tops of
      the surrounding hills, I approached the once glorious, and
      still sacred, city of Jerusalem&mdash;that chosen seat of the
      Godhead&mdash;that Queen among the nations. Eclipsed, though
      it was, and its majestic head trodden into the dust, by the
      foot of the infidel, my gladdened eyes dwelt upon what was
      imperishable, and my wrapt imagination pictured what was
      destroyed. The valleys of Jehosaphat and Gehinnon, Mount
      Calvary, Mount Zion, and Mount Acre, stretched before me. The
      palace of King Herod, with its sumptuous halls of marble and
      of gold&mdash;the gorgeous Temple of Solomon&mdash;the lofty
      towers of Phaseolus and Mariamne&mdash;the palace of the
      Maccabees&mdash;the Hippodrome&mdash;the houses of many of
      the prophets&mdash;grew into existence again, beneath the
      creative force of fancy. I stood and wept. I knelt, and
      kissed the consecrated earth which once a Saviour trod."

      COUNTRY CHARACTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Country society has but little relief; and in proportion to
      intellectual refinement, this monotony appears to increase.
      We have always been favourable to Book Clubs in country
      towns, and about ten years since, established one in the
      anti-social town of &mdash;&mdash;. The plan worked well; its
      economy was admired, and extensively adopted all over
      England, but we heard little of its contributing to the
      social enjoyments of the people. Twenty families reading the
      same books, and these passed from house to house, among the
      respectability of the town, might have brought about a kind
      of consanguinity of opinion, and led to frequent interchange
      of civilities, meetings of the members at each others'
      houses, or at least a sort of how-d'ye-do acquaintance. The
      case was otherwise. The attorney and the doctor joined our
      society that their families of ten or twelve sons and
      daughters might keep under the sixpences and shillings of the
      circulating library; but they soon became jealous of <i>new
      books</i>, although they often returned them uncut and
      unread; and so far from knitting the bonds of acquaintance,
      we at last thought our plan served to estrange the members,
      by affording the little aristocracy frequent opportunities
      for venting their splenetic pride; the books were like
      <i>disjunctive conjunctions</i>, and when we left the place,
      the "society" did not promise to live another year.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could entertain ourselves, at least, with sketches of a
      few of the members of this disjointed body; but we must be
      content with one, and that shall be the <i>bookseller</i> of
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a man of middle height, rather inclined to obesity,
      and just turned of fifty-eight. He had a broad, low forehead,
      sunken eyes, an aquiline nose, a heavy, hanging lip, and a
      chin which buried its projections in ample and unclassical
      folds of neckerchief. He was bald, except a tuft on the
      <i>occiput</i>, or hinder part of his head, and on dress
      occasions he wore powder. He was a widower, his wife having
      been dead about ten years, leaving him two daughters, the
      amiability of whose dispositions was a painful contrast to
      the uneven temper of their father. He kept a good table, and
      had the best cellar of grape wine in the town, but
      entertained little company. His guests were usually the
      valets or butlers of the gentry in the neighbourhood; but the
      housekeepers were never invited by his daughters, a point of
      propriety in male and female acquaintanceship which amused us
      not a little. His business was of a most multifarious
      description, and besides the trades of bookseller, stationer,
      and druggist, he had a printing-office, and was, moreover, a
      self-taught printer, He was post-master and stamp
      sub-distributor, receiver of bail, and agent for
      insurances&mdash;little official appointments which would
      have made him mayor in a corporate town. Of late years, he
      seldom meddled with these matters of business; but tired of
      their common track, he struck out a course of life, which was
      neither public nor private, but made him a sort of oracle in
      the town, whose opinions were freely printed and gratuitously
      circulated, whilst the author was seldom seen except at
      vestry-meetings. In this way he acted as secretary to a
      benevolent society established by the gentry, and such was
      his enthusiasm that he gave his services and &pound;200.
      worth of printing during the first year; and the Committee in
      return presented him with a handsome piece of plate with a
      complimentary inscription, which he had the modesty to keep
      locked up, and never to display even to his visiters. This
      proved him to be a benevolent man, and he would have been ten
      times more useful had not his charitable disposition been
      over tinged with oddity and caprice. His contact with the
      poor of the parish soon made him overseer, although his
      religious observances would not qualify him for churchwarden;
      for he only went to church at funerals, to which he was
      frequently invited, his staid appearance, and a certain air
      of gentility of which he was master, being in such cases no
      mean recommendation. Overseer and select vestryman, he
      printed the parish accounts, for the most part gratuitously,
      although the poor and even the better portion of the
      towns-people never gave him full credit for this generosity,
      conceiving that he was repaid by some secret services or
      funds. The oddity of his
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page425" name="page425"></a>[pg
      425]</span> pursuits was only exceeded by their variety. In
      politics he was a disciple of Cobbett, and year after year,
      foretold a revolution, an alarm which he communicated to
      every one of his household. He took extreme interest in all
      new mechanical projects, but seldom indulged in the practical
      part of them. In wine-making he was once a very
      experimentalist, and studied every line of Macculloch and
      unripe fruit; next, he turned over every inch of his garden,
      analyzed the soil <i>&agrave; la</i> Davy, and <i>salted</i>
      all his growing crops. His cogitative habits led him to take
      long walks in the country, and he soon flew from
      horticultural chemistry to real farming; and about the same
      time took to road making and macadamization, and became a
      surveyor of the highways. But the trustees wanting to
      macadamize the miserably pitched street of the town, he
      bethought him of dust in summer and mud in winter, and drew
      up a long memorial to the lords of the soil, remonstrating
      with them on their impolitic conduct; but all in vain. It is
      curious, however, to reflect that what the people of a
      country town about ten years ago thought a curse to their
      roads should now be adopted in many of the principal London
      Streets. The last we heard of our bookseller's hobbies, was
      that he had bought the lease of a house for the sake of the
      large garden attached to it, and here, like Evelyn in his
      <i>Elysium Britannicum</i>, he passes his days in the
      primitive occupation of gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our bookseller is a self-educated man, and in some pamphlets
      on the charitable institution to which we have alluded, are
      many of the errors of style peculiar to self-educated
      writers. Among his acquaintance we remember an attorney who
      practised in London, but had a small house in the town. He
      had been editor and proprietor of four or five morning and
      evening newspapers, and furnished our bookseller with all the
      news off 'Change and about town. This friend and the journals
      were his oracles, and their influence he digested in morsels
      of political economy, so introduced into his pamphlets as not
      to offend the landed gentry of the neighbourhood. To them, it
      should be mentioned, he was a most useful personage, and his
      aid and auspices, were almost necessary to the success of any
      project for the interest of the town. The trades-people
      looked up to him; they would agree if Mr. &mdash;&mdash; did,
      or they would wait his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard that he has been a gallant in his time; and
      more than once he has told little stories of dances and
      harvest homes, and merry meetings at the wealthy farmers' in
      the neighbourhood, of the moonlight walk home, and of his
      companions counting their won guineas on their return from an
      evening party&mdash;all of which throw into shade the social
      amusements of our artificial times. We have said that he kept
      a good table; for presents of game poured in from the
      gentlemen's bailiffs in the neighbourhood, fish from town to
      be repaid by summer visits, and if the fishmonger of the
      place was overstocked, the first person he sent to was our
      bookseller. Again, he would take a post-chaise, or the White
      Hart barouche, for a party of pleasure, when his neighbours
      would have been happy with a gig. He did not join, or allow
      his daughters to mix with them at the tradesman's ball, but
      they staid moping at home, because there was none between the
      gentry and trade. Yet the professional and little-fortune
      people cried &mdash;&mdash; trade, and thus our bookseller
      belonged to neither class. The people of the place know not
      whether he is rich; he has been "making money" all his
      life-time say they, but he has "lived away." It is, however,
      to be regretted that they cannot settle the point, since they
      determine to a pound the income of every gentleman and lady
      in the neighbourhood, and, doff their hats according to the
      total.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up his character, he is just and sometimes generous;
      hospitable but not unostentatious; dictatorial and
      circumlocutory to excess in his conversation, and of an
      inquisitive turn of mind, and considering his resources, he
      is well informed and even clever in matters of the world; in
      short, he is a perfect pattern of the gentleman tradesmen of
      the present day.

      A pamphlet of <i>Twenty-four Letters from Labourers in

      our hands. These letters have been addressed by emigrants to
      their relatives in the eastern part of Sussex, and have been
      printed <i>literatim</i>. We are aware of the strong
      prejudice which exists against the practice of parishes
      sending off annually, a part of their surplus population to
      America; but some of the statements in these letters will
      stagger the <i>Noes</i>. We quote a few from letters written

      that winter is a dead time in America; but we have found it
      as well and better than we expected. We can get good flour
      for 11<i>d</i>. English money; good beef for 2<i>d</i>. or
      3<i>d</i> do, and mutton the same price; pork about
      4<i>d</i>.; sugar, very good, 5<i>d</i>.; butter and cheese
      is not much cheaper than in England; clothing is rather dear,
      especially woollen; worsted stockings are dear.

      Dear Father and Mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      I now take the opportunity of writing to you since our long
      journey. But I am very sorry to tell you, that we had the
      misfortune to lose both our little boys; Edward died 29th
      April, and William 5th May; the younger died with bowel
      complaint; the other with the rash-fever and sore throat. We
      were very much hurt to have them buried in a watery grave; we
      mourned their loss; night and day they were not out of our
      minds. We had a minister on board, who prayed with us twice a
      day; he was a great comfort to us, on the account of losing
      our poor little children. He said, The Lord gave, and taketh
      away; and blessed be the name of the Lord. We should make
      ourselves contented if we had our poor little children here
      with us: we kept our children 24 hours. There were six
      children and one woman died in the vessel. Master Bran lost
      his wife. Mrs. Coshman, from Bodiam, lost her two only
      children. My sister Mary and her two children are living at
      Olbourn, about 80 miles from us. Little Caroline and father
      is living with us; and our three brothers are living within a
      mile of us. Brother James was very ill coming over, with the
      same complaint that William had. We were very sick for three
      weeks, coming over: John was very hearty, and so was father.
      We were afraid we should loose little Caroline; but the
      children and we are hearty at this time. Sarah and Caroline
      are often speaking of going to see their grandmother. Mary's
      children were all well, except little John; he was bad with a
      great cold. I have got a house and employ. I have 4<i>s</i>.
      a day and my board; and in harvest and haying I am to have
      6<i>s</i>. or 7<i>s</i>. a day and my board. We get wheat for
      7<i>s</i>. per bushel, of our money; that is about 3<i>s</i>.
      7<i>d</i>. of your money; meat is about 3<i>d</i>. per pound;
      butter from 5<i>d</i>. to 6<i>d</i>.; sugar about the same as
      in England; shoes and clothes about the same as it is with
      you; tea is from 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
      of your money; tobacco is about 9<i>d</i>. per pound, of your
      money; good whisky about 1<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. per gallon;

      I must tell you a little what friends we met with when we
      landed in to Hudson; such friends as we never found in
      England; but it was chiefly from that people that love and
      fear God. We had so much meat brought us, that we could not
      eat while it was good; a whole quarter of a calf at once; so
      we had two or three quarters in a little time, and seven
      stone of beef. One old gentleman came and brought us a wagon
      load of wood, and two chucks of bacon; some sent flour, some
      bread, some cheese, some soap, some candles, some chairs,
      some bedsteads. One class-leader sent us 3<i>s</i>. worth of
      tin ware and many other things. The flowers are much here as
      yours; provision is not very cheap; flour is 1<i>s</i>.
      7<i>d</i>. a gallon of this money, about 10<i>d</i>. of
      yours; butter is 1<i>s</i>., your money 6<i>d</i>.; meat from

      Dear Children,
    </p>
    <p>
      I now write for the third time since I left old England. I
      wrote a letter, dated October 8th; and finding that it would
      have four weeks to lay, I was afraid you would not have it;
      and as I told you I would write the truth, if I was forced to
      beg my bread from door to door, so I now proceed. Dear
      children, I write to let you know that we are all in good
      health, excepting your mother; and she is now just put to bed
      of another son, and she is as well as can be expected. And
      now as it respects what I have got in America: I have got
      12-1/2 acres of land, about half improved, and the rest in
      the state of nature, and two cows of my own. We can buy good
      land for 18<i>s</i>. per acre; but buying of land is not one
      quarter part, for the land is as full of trees as your woods
      are of stubs; and they are from four to ten rods long, and
      from one to five feet through them. You may buy land here
      from 18<i>s</i>. to 9<i>l</i>. in English money; and it will
      bring from 20 to 40 bushels of wheat per acre, and corn from
      20 to 50 bushels per acre, and rye from 20 to 40 ditto. You
      may buy beef for 1-3/4<i>d</i>. per pound; and mutton the
      same; Irish butter 7<i>d</i>. per pound; cheese 3<i>d</i>.;
      tea 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; sugar 7<i>d</i>. per pound;
      candles 7<i>d</i>.; soap 7<i>d</i>.; and wheat 4<i>s</i>.
      6<i>d</i>. per bushel; corn and rye
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page427" name="page427"></a>[pg
      427]</span> 2<i>s</i>. per bushel. And I get 2<i>s</i>.
      4<i>d</i>. a day and my board; and have as much meat to eat,
      three times a day, as I like to eat. But clothing is dear;
      shoes 8<i>s</i>.; half boots 16<i>s</i>.; calico from
      8<i>d</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.; stockings 2<i>s</i>.
      9<i>d</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.; flannel 4<i>s</i>. per
      yard; superfine cloth from 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to
      1<i>l</i>.; now all this is counted in English money. We get
      4<i>s</i>. per day in summer, and our board; and if you count
      the difference of the money, you will soon find it out;
      8<i>s</i>. in our money is 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in your
      money.

      KENILWORTH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Every body knows the delightful romance of
      Kenilworth,&mdash;a tragedy, of which the dramatis personae
      are the parties themselves, called up from their graves by
      the novelist magician. Students who attend St. Mary's Church,
      Oxford, still look out for the flat stone which covers the
      dust and bones of poor Amy, and could any sculptured effigies
      supply the place of the whole historical picture, then
      imagined in the mind's eye? More than once attracted by the
      old ballad,<a id="footnotetag1"
      name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      we have, when undergraduates, walked to the "lonely towers of
      Cumnor Hall," fancied that we saw her struggle, and heard her
      screams, when she was thrown over the staircase (the
      traditional mode of her assassination,) and wondered how any
      man could have the heart to murder a simple lovesick pretty
      girl. Even now, in sorrow and in sadness, we read this
      account:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Amye Duddley (for so she subscribes herself
      in the Harleian Manuscript, 4712,) the first wife of Lord
      Robert Dudley, Queen Elizabeth's favourite, and after Amy's
      death Earl of Leicester, was daughter of Sir John Robsart.
      Her marriage took place June 4, 1550, the day following that
      on which her lord's eldest brother had been united to a
      daughter of the Duke of Somerset, and the event is thus
      recorded by King Edward in his Diary: "4. S. Robert dudeley,
      third sonne to th' erle of warwic, married S. John Robsartes
      daughter; after wich mariage ther were certain gentlemen that
      did strive who shuld first take away a gose's heade wich was
      hanged alive on tow crose postes." Soon after the accession
      of Elizabeth, when Dudley's ambitious views of a royal
      alliance had opened upon him, his countess mysteriously died
      at the retired mansion of Cumnor near
      Abingdon,<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
      Sept. 8, 1560; and, although the mode of her death is
      imperfectly ascertained (her body was thrown down stairs, as
      a blind,) there appears far greater foundation for supposing
      the earl guilty of her murder, than usually belongs to such
      rumours, all her other attendants being absent at Abingdon
      fair, except Sir Richard Verney and his man. The
      circumstances, distorted by gross anachronisms, have been
      weaved into the delightful romance of "Kenilworth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the goose and posts, <i>we</i> can suggest no better
      explanation than that the goose was intended for poor Amy,
      and the cross posts for the Protector Somerset, and his rival
      Dudley Duke of Northumberland, both of whom were bred to the
      devil's trade, ambition. Others may be possessed of more
      successful elucidation. At all events, it is plain that the
      people had a very suspicious opinion of Leicester, amounting
      to this, that he was a great rascal, who played a deep game,
      and stuck at nothing which he could do without danger to
      himself.<a id="footnotetag3"

      MEXICAN MINES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It appears that, on an average of the fifteen years previous
      to the revolution, about twenty-two millions of dollars were
      exported, and that there was an accumulation of about two
      millions. Since the revolution, the exports have averaged
      13,587,052 dollars, while the produce has decreased to eleven
      millions. This change was the natural consequence of the
      revolution. The favourable accounts of Humboldt excited a
      spirit of speculation that was wholly regardless of passing
      events; and the Act of Congress, facilitating the
      co-operation of foreigners with the natives, produced a mania
      which has been destructive to numberless individuals, who
      trusted too much to names. Seven English companies, with a
      capital of at least three millions, were established, and
      these were followed by two American, and one German,
      companies. Such was the rage for mining on the Royal
      Exchange, that for a time it was only necessary for any one
      to appear with contracts made with Mexican mine owners to
      establish a company. Many who were so ignorant as not even to
      know the difference between a shaft and a level, commenced
      speculators, not for the purpose of fairly earning a reward
      for doing some service to those to whom they offered their
      mines, but to fill their own
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name="page428"></a>[pg
      428]</span> purses without reference to consequences. Such a
      system of unprincipled conduct could not last; almost all the
      minor performers have been driven from the stage, and the
      respectable associations alone maintain their footing, though
      the want of returns for the immense sums invested has tended
      to produce a general want of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since these enterprises have been undertaken, an immense and
      fruitless expenditure has been incurred by sending out
      machinery, which could be of no earthly use&mdash;by
      despising the native processes, and substituting others that
      have been found wholly inapplicable&mdash;and by introducing
      British labourers, who when abroad reverse all the good
      qualities for which they are valuable at home. A reform in
      this system we believe to have been generally adopted, and we
      are sure that a reduction of expense, a management purely
      European, and native labour, with only such modifications in
      working, smelting, or amalgamating, as experience will prove
      to be advantageous, will, in a moderate time, return the
      capital already expended, with a commensurate advantage. But
      these things can only take place provided the public
      tranquillity be maintained, and the government keep their
      engagements with foreigners inviolate. The insecurity arising
      from the domestic feuds now disturbing this fine country,
      must, if it continues, finally annihilate its best
      resources.&mdash;<i>Foreign Quarterly Review.</i>

    <h3>
      LADY-POETS OF ENGLAND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following is a Frenchman's expression of homage to our
      modern female poets, in which we excel all the world:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable, that in the latter years of the eighteenth
      century, and also during the whole course of our revolution,
      there appeared in England a whole school, as it were, of
      female authors, whose pure and graceful productions are
      disfigured by no exaggerations, nor are they of that sombre
      character which distinguishes the modern literature of their
      country. Of the lady-authors of England, the most celebrated
      is Lady Wortley Montagu, the contemporary of Pope, who has
      left poems, but more especially letters, highly remarkable
      for their talent and philosophy. It is impossible to give
      here the names of the authoresses who appeared all on a
      sudden about half a century after Lady Wortley Montagu. One
      of the earliest of them was a lady of the same name, Mrs. E.
      Montagu, the author of the Essays on Shakspeare, and Mrs.
      Anna Laetitia Barbauld, who wrote numerous poems and
      admirable hymns for children. There is great beauty in the
      Epistle of Mrs. Barbauld to Wilberforce, on the subject of
      the Abolition of the Slave Trade (1781.) Mrs. Hannah More has
      also written several works of <i>religious fiction</i>, and
      above all, some charming poems; Florio (1786,) and the Blue
      Stocking, or Conversation. The Blue Stocking is a burlesque
      name given to a lady's coterie, in which several females
      attempted to start a sort of <i>bureau d'esprit</i> under the
      direction of Mesdames Robinson and Piozzi, a coterie innocent
      enough, but which excited the wrath of Mr. Gifford, the
      Editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, who fulminated against
      it several satires in excessively bad taste, and written in a
      tone of disgusting pedantry. The verses of Mr. Gifford are
      infinitely more ridiculous than those he pretends to correct.
      Amongst the English ladies who have written romance, Miss
      Edgeworth, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page429"
      name="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span> Mrs. Inchbald, and Lady
      Morgan, are worthy of especial note. Several ladies, without
      having written works of great importance, have still produced
      poetical pieces of graceful beauty; in this number it is but
      justice to distinguish Mrs. Opie. And lastly, in order to
      finish this hasty catalogue, we may remark that there have
      appeared in England, in our days, several ladies of a high
      order of literary, poetical, and at the same time,
      philosophical talent. Lady Morgan herself has contrived to
      mix up history and romance in her writings, with great
      ability; but among the ladies, who inscribed their fame on
      monuments more durable than romantic stories, we must select
      for honourable mention the names of Joanna Baillie, Aikin,
      Benger, and Helen Maria Williams. Miss Baillie, sister of the
      celebrated Dr. Baillie, the physician, is a woman of the
      highest talent. It is not your pretty nothings, your elegant
      trifles, which occupy her genius; on the contrary, she has
      attempted in a series of dramatic pieces, to paint the most
      energetic passion of the human heart; and her pieces, written
      in the most elevated and <i>Shakspearian</i> tone, will
      always be regarded as the work of a superior mind. John
      Kemble, in the part of <i>Montfort</i>, reached the sublime
      of agony. In the writings of Miss Baillie there is a
      combination of the solemn and the poetical, which is rarely
      observed in women. Miss Aikin has written some charming
      poems, far more beautiful than any I have met with in the
      writings of Miss Landon and Miss Mitford. The <i>Mouse's
      Petition</i>, by Miss Aikin, is a <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>. Miss
      Benger has published some historical works of great interest,
      which place her in the same line with Miss Aikin. Lastly,
      there is Helen Maria Williams, whose muse, half English, half
      French, has published poems, sonnets, and other pieces of
      verse, besides several political and historical works. This
      superior woman, at the same time that she gave birth, under
      the influence of sensibility and fancy, to works of
      inspiration, portrayed the details of the events of the
      French revolution, in the centre of which she threw herself,
      in 1792, from pure enthusiasm for liberty.&mdash;<i>Foreign

      AMERICAN LAW.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "No commentator," says Judge Hall, in his Letters from the
      West, "has taken any notice of <i>Linch's Law</i>, which was
      once the <i>lex loci</i> of the frontiers. Its operation was
      as follows:&mdash;When a horse thief, a counterfeiter, or any
      other desperate vagabond, infested a neighbourhood, evading
      justice by cunning, or by a strong arm, or by the number of
      his confederates, the citizens formed themselves into a
      "<i>regulating company</i>," a kind of holy brotherhood,
      whose duty was to purge the community of its unruly members.
      Mounted, armed, and commanded by a leader, they proceeded to
      arrest such notorious offenders as were deemed fit subjects
      of exemplary justice; their operations were generally carried
      on in the night. Squire Birch, who was personated by one of
      the party, established his tribunal under a tree in the
      woods, and the culprit was brought before him, tried, and
      generally convicted; he was then tied to a tree, lashed
      without mercy, and ordered to leave the country within a
      given time, under pain of a second visitation. It seldom
      happened that more than one or two were thus punished; their
      confederates took the hint and fled, or were admonished to
      quit the neighbourhood."

      MONUMENTAL ALTERATION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following odd story is related respecting a monument in a
      chapel, adjoining <i>Stene</i>, a fine family seat in the
      north:&mdash;The sculptor, in that vile taste which seems to
      have originated in an unhappy design of making every thing
      connected with the grave revolting to our feelings, had
      ornamented this monument with "a very ghastly, grinning
      alabaster skull;" and the bishop one day expressed a wish to
      his domestic chaplain, Dr. Grey, that it had not been placed
      there. Grey, upon this, sent to Banbury for the sculptor, and
      consulted with him whether it was not possible to convert it
      into a soothing, instead of a painful object. After some
      consideration, the artist declared that the only thing into
      which he could possibly convert it was&mdash;a bunch of
      grapes! and accordingly, at this day, a bunch of grapes may
      be seen upon the monument; for the chapel, which for a time
      had been abandoned to the rooks and daws who built their
      nests among the monuments, has been repaired, and is now
      united to the rectory of Hinton.

      his guest may take it for a token that he loves his wine
      better than his friends, is obliged to feign an unwillingness
      to leave the bottle, and, as Sponge says&mdash;"In

      THE MEXICAN NAVY

      Is in a most deplorable state. The difficulty of reducing the
      Castle of San Juan de Ulloa led to the collection of some
      gun-boats, a couple of sloops of war, and two or three armed
      schooners. This number has since received the addition of a
      line of battle ship, two frigates, and some other vessels of

      vain-glorious memory, (who once wrote a book of Voyages,)
      was, and may be still, the marine commandant, and
      distinguished himself by threatening to blockade Cuba, and by
      being obliged to skulk at Key West, to avoid destruction by
      the gallant Laborde. The Mexicans require no navy, and cannot
      maintain one; the sooner, therefore, they restrict it to a
      very few revenue cutters the better. The nature of the
      country and the destructive climate of the coast, diminish
      greatly the necessity for keeping up a military establishment
      for <i>external</i> defence. Foreign invasion can do little;
      more is to be dreaded from internal
      dissensions.&mdash;<i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>.

      A prudent host, who is not in the humour to submit to an
      attack from "staunch topers," "who love to keep it up" as
      <i>bons vivants</i>, whose favourite song is ever "<i>Fly not
      yet</i>," will engage some sober friends to fight on his
      side, and at a certain hour to vote for "no more wine," and
      bravely demand "tea," and will select his company with as
      much care as a chemist composes a neutral salt, judiciously
      providing quite as large a proportion of alkali (tea men) as
      he has of acid (wine men.) To adjust the balance of power at
      the court of Bacchus, occasionally requires as much address
      as sagacious politicians say is sometimes requisite to direct
      the affairs of other courts.

      MAKING TEA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It has been long observed that the infusion of tea made in
      silver, or polished metal tea-pots, is stronger than that
      which is produced in black, or other kinds of earthenware
      pots. This is explained on the principle, that polished
      surfaces retain heat much better than dark, rough surfaces,
      and that, consequently, the caloric being confined in the
      former case, must act more powerfully than in the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is further certain, that the silver or metal pot, when
      filled a second time, produces worse tea than the earthenware
      vessel; and that it is advisable to use the earthenware pot,
      unless a silver or metal one can be procured sufficiently
      large to contain at once all that may be required. These
      facts are readily explained by considering, that the action
      of heat retained by the silver vessel so far exhausts the
      herb as to leave very little soluble substance for a second
      infusion; whereas the reduced temperature of the water in the
      earthenware pot, by extracting only a small proportion at
      first, leaves some soluble matter for the action of a
      subsequent infusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for pouring boiling water into the tea-pot before
      the infusion of the tea is made, is, that the vessel being
      previously warm, may abstract less heat from the mixture, and
      thus admit a more powerful action. Neither is it difficult to
      explain the fact why the infusion of tea is stronger if only
      a small quantity of boiling water be first used, and more be
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page431" name="page431"></a>[pg
      431]</span> added some time afterwards; for if we consider
      that only the water immediately in contact with the herb can
      act upon it, and that it cools very rapidly, especially in
      earthenware vessels, it is clear that the effect will be
      greater where the heat is kept up by additions of boiling
      water, than where the vessel is filled at once, and the fluid
      suffered gradually to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the infusion has once been completed, it is found that
      any further addition of the herb only affords a very small
      increase in the strength, the water having cooled much below
      the boiling point, and consequently, acting very slightly.

      THE NATURALIST.
    </h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>
      THE HUMAN EAR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The ear consists of three principal divisions, viz. the
      external, intermediate, and internal ear. The different parts
      of the first division, or external ear, are described by
      anatomists under the name of the helix, antihelix, tragus,
      antitragus, the lobe, cavitas innominata, the scapha, and the
      concha. In the middle of the external ear is the meatus, or
      passage, which varies in length in different individuals. The
      external or outward ear is designed by nature to stand
      prominent, and to bear its proportion in the symmetry of the
      head, but in Europe it is greatly flattened by the pressure
      of the dress; it consists chiefly of elastic cartilage,
      formed with different hollows, or sinuosities, all leading
      into each other, and finally terminating in the concha, or
      immediate opening into the tube of the ear. This form is
      admirably adapted for the reception of sound, for collecting
      and retaining it, so that it may not pass off, or be sent too
      rapidly to the seat of the impression. There have been a few
      instances of men who had the power of moving the external ear
      in a similar manner to that of animals; but these instances
      are very rare, and rather deviations from the general
      structure; nor did it appear in these instances that such
      individuals heard more acutely: a proof that such a structure
      would be of no advantage to the human subject. With respect
      to the external ear in man, whether it is completely removed
      either by accident or design, deafness ensues, although its
      partial removal is not attended with this inconvenience: the
      external ear, therefore, or something in its form to collect
      sound, is a necessary part of the organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next division is the intermediate ear; it consists of the
      tympanum, mastoid cells, and Eustachian tube. The tympanum
      contains four small delicate bones, viz. the malleus, the
      incus, the stapes, and the os orbiculare, joined to the
      incus. The intermediate ear displays an irregular cavity,
      having a membrane, called the membrana tympani, stretched
      across its extremity; and this cavity has a communication
      with the external air, through the Eustachian tube, which
      leads into the fauces, or throat. The membrane of the
      tympanum is intended to carry the vibrations of the
      atmosphere, collected by the outward ear, to the chain of
      bones which form the peculiar mechanism of the tympanum.
      Besides the effect of the hard and bony parts of the ear in
      increasing the power of sound, the tension of the different
      membranes is also a requisite: thus various muscles are so
      situated as to put the membrane on the stretch, that the
      sound, striking upon it, may, from its tension, similar to
      that of the parchment of a drum-head, have full influence
      upon the sense. In respect to its tension, the membrane of
      the tympanum may be also compared, not unaptly, to the string
      of a violin, or musical instrument, even more properly than
      to a drum; as the state of tension and relaxation in such
      chords produces a variety of sound in the instrument, so, in
      the same manner, circumstances, which affect the tension and
      relaxation of the tympanum, vary most perceptibly its powers
      of action, and the customary agency of the organ. Its four
      bones act mechanically, in consequence of the power of the
      local muscles: they strike like the key of an instrument, and
      produce a percussion on the nerves of the tympanum. Not only
      may the membrane of the tympanum be partially destroyed, and
      hearing be preserved, but the small bones of the tympanum
      have been in certain cases lost, or have come away, from
      ulceration, and through a constitutional or other cause; but
      in such cases it appears that the stapes was, in most
      instances, left, and thus the openings of the fenestra ovata
      and fenestra rotunda were preserved, which prevented the
      escape of sound from the labyrinth and internal parts. With
      respect to the Eustachian tube, its aperture into the throat
      seems indispensable to hearing; and whenever closed, from
      malconfirmation or disease, deafness is the certain
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third division of the organ is the internal ear, which is
      called the labyrinth; it is divided into the vestibule, three
      semicircular canals, and the cochlea: the whole are incased
      within the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The internal
      ear may be considered as the actual seat of the organ; it
      consists of a nervous expansion of high sensibility, the
      sentient <span class="pagenum"><a id="page432"
      name="page432"></a>[pg 432]</span> extremities of which
      spread in every direction, and in the most minute manner;
      inosculating with each other, and forming plexus, by which
      the auricular sense is increased. Here, also, sound is
      collected and retained by the mastoid cells and cochlea. To
      this apparatus is added the presence of a fluid, contained in
      sacs and membranes; as this fluid is in large quantities in
      some animals, there is no doubt it is intended as an
      additional means for enforcing the impression: the known
      influence of water, as a powerful medium or conductor of
      sound, strengthens this idea. The internal ear of man,
      therefore, has all the known varieties of apparatus, which
      are only partially present in other classes of the creation;
      and its perfection is best judged of, by considering the
      variety or form of the internal ear of other animals. The
      internal ear of some animals consists of little more than a
      sac of fluid, on which is expanded a small nervous pulp;
      according to the situation of this, whether the creature
      lives in water, or is partially exposed to the air, it has an
      external opening with the ear, or otherwise.&mdash;<i>Lecture

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
